# Pizza Sales Business Performance

Overview:
Here I will analyze key indicators for this pizza sales data, to gain insights into the business performance. I will calculate the following metrics:

1.	Total Revenue
2.	Average Order Value 
3.	Total Pizzas Sold
4.	Total Orders
5.	Average Pizzas per Order

I will also create charts and a dashboard to visualize different aspects of the pizza sales, to gain insight and understanding of key trends. I will create charts that showcase:

1.	Daily trend for Total orders – Here I created a bar chart to display the daily trend of total orders over a specific time period 
2.	Hourly trend for Total orders – Here I created a line chart to display hourly trend of total orders throughout the day. 
3.	Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category – Here I created a pie chart that displays the distribution of sales across different Pizza Categories.
4.	Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size – Here I created a pie chart that represents the percentage of sales attributed to different pizza sales.
5.	Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category – Here I created a funnel chart that presents the total number of pizzas sold for each pizza category.
6.	Top 5 Best Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold – Here I created a bar chart that highlights the top 5 best pizza sellers based on the total number of pizzas sold.
7.	Bottom 5 Worst Sellers by Total Pizzas Sold -  Here I will create a bar chart to showcase the bottom 5 worst pizza sellers based on the total number of pizzas sold.
